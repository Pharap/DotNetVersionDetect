# DotNetVersionDetect
A simple program designed to report the version of the .Net Framework installed

Please note that this program is very crude and should not be used as a robust solution.  
It's merely a crude implementation suitable only for hobbyists as a lightweight and quick way to check .Net versions past 4.5.
